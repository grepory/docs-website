With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, you can be notified of unusual app behavior and access an automatic analysis of this unusual behavior. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are automatically available in NRDB for dashboarding, alerting, and integration with Incident Intelligence.

## Why it matters

With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in an overview of anomalies, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook.

## How it works

Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data:

1. Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors.
2. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior.
3. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data.

**Receiving notifications:** We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you can choose to just save the events to NRDB.

**Anomaly analysis:** For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly.

**Activity stream:** Inside the activity stream on the New Relic One homepage and the APM Summary page you will see relevant anomalies for applications that you've configured with Proactive Detection. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream will bring up the analysis page for that anomaly.

Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections.

## Requirements

To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have:

* An APM agent installed on applications to monitor
* To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application into [your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-workspace).

For more details, see [Data limits](#data-limits).

## Set up Proactive Detection [#set-up]

You can configure this feature in the Proactive Detection UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Proactive Detection** to go to **Configuration**.
2. Click **Add a configuration**.
3. Input the following information into the form:

   * Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account.
   * Select an account.
   * Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation.
4. Select the golden signals you would like to monitor for anomalies.

## Mute notifications (Slack only) [#mute-notifications]

In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted.

To mute in Slack, select **Mute this app’s warnings** or **Mute all warnings**, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed.

Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Proactive Detection**, and select the configuration to edit.

Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts.

## Use Proactive Detection Slack messages [#feedback]

Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue:

* The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One.
* The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One.
* A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree.
* An **Analyze** button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals.

Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select **Yes** or **No**.

## View overview of anomalies [#anomaly-overview]

In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the [Anomalies tab](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page#anomalies) on the [Alerts & AI Overview page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page). That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis.

## Use anomaly events with NRDB [#anomaly-events]

Once you configure Proactive Detection, anomaly events will be sent to New Relic’s database (NRDB). You can query NRDB for Proactive Detection anomaly events and use them in conjunction with other Applied Intelligence tools.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser

## Send Proactive Detection events to Incident Intelligence [#send-events]

You can send Proactive Detection events to Incident Intelligence to be processed and correlated with other activity in your system:

1. Create an [alert condition for your NRQL query](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) that pulls proactive detection events from NRDB.
2. Configure a new incident intelligence [source for your condition](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/get-started-incident-intelligence#configure-source-nr-alerts).
3. (Optional) Create [Decision logic](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/get-started-incident-intelligence#decisions) to correlate future anomalies with related events.

## Webhook payload and examples [#webhook]

Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema.
