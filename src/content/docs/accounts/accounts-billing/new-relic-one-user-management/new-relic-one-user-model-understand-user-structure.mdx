  New Relic One
  user model
---

In mid-2020, New Relic released a newer user model, referred to as the New Relic One user model. 

<Callout variant="important">
  If you had a New Relic organization created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). For more on this, see [Pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#determine-user-model).
</Callout>

This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including:

* [User type](#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
* [User groups](#groups)
* [User roles](#roles) and how they relate to user type and groups

For how to add and manage users, see [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants).

## User type: basic and full [#user-type]

  <Callout variant="important">
On March 1, 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. Previously these basic users had the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our [Explorer's Hub post on basic user changes](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/basic-users-can-now-request-upgrades-to-full-stack-observability-uis-on-march-1/139782).
    </Callout>

For users on both of our [user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), the user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to.

Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing impacts only apply if you're on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans). 

* **Basic user**. Details:
  * These users are free and have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do **not** have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities)).
  * With the Standard [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing), these users can only be assigned to the default [**User**](#groups) group.
  * No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the [capabilities of a basic user](#user-capabilities): no more and no less.
  * Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. There are prompts to upgrade when a basic user attempts to access a full-user-only feature.
* **Full user**. Details:
  * These users are billable and have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on feature access, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities).
  * These users can be added to the default [**Admin**](#groups) group.
  * The Standard [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) includes one free full user and up to five total.

How you change a user's type depends on the user model they're on: 

* See [original user model docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#user-type). 
* See [New Relic One user model docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

    Below is a table showing basic user versus full user capabilities. In short, basic users have access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](https://newrelic.com/platform) and [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform) features, while full users have access to all of that plus [Full-Stack Observability](https://newrelic.com/platform) features.

    Reasons to make someone a full user:

    * They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle.
    * They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team.
    * They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD).
    * They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform.
    * They need to be able to manage users and/or billing.

    Reasons to make someone a basic user:

    * They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle.
    * They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team).
    * They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives).
    * They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform.
    * They don't manage users.

## Default user groups: Admin and User [#groups]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

A user group allows managing multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group and that group is granted access to specific roles and specific accounts.

We have two default user groups available for full users:

* **User**: Adding someone to this group allows them to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but **not** perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users.
* **Admin**: Adding someone to this group gives them the abilities of the User group and also gives them access to account/organization-related abilities like managing billing-related settings and managing users.

To edit a user's group, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

See the [roles and capabilities these default groups have](#group-roles).

Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can create their own [custom roles and custom groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/organization-level-user-management-roles-groups-access-grants).

## Roles and capabilities [#roles]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

Roles are a set of capabilities. A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' ([see more examples](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants#custom-role)).

We provide some default standard roles (below). Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can also create [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants#custom-role).

### Standard roles

Our standard roles are default sets of capabilities that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. These standard roles are [assigned to our default **Admin** and **User** groups](#group-roles), but you can also assign these roles to a custom group.

Most standard roles have capabilities that are unique and that can't be replicated with a custom role. For example, to assign billing management capabilities to a user, you'd need to assign them the **Billing user** role; you wouldn't be able to assign billing management capability with a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with custom roles are **Read only**, **Standard user**, and **All product admin** (this role is the equivalent of choosing all available capabilities).

Standard roles include:

### Roles and user groups [#group-roles]

There are two default user groups available: [**User** and **Admin**](#groups). These groups have our [standard roles](#standard-roles) applied in these ways:

* **User**: this group has only the **All product admin** standard role, which grants general platform access and some basic admin capabilities.
* **Admin**: this group has all the standard roles, giving it complete admin capabilities.

Custom groups can be assigned standard roles or custom roles.

### Roles and user type [#user-type-roles]

User type refers to whether a user is a basic user or a full user.

A basic user can be defined as having the **All product admin** [standard role](#standard-roles) but without access to Full-Stack Observability features ([learn more](#user-type)). A basic user always has basic user capabilities, no more and no less, regardless of what group they're assigned to. One nonintuitive impact of this is that a group's basic users could have more capabilities than its full users have. For example, if you created a custom group with very minimal capabilities, the full users in that group would have those minimal capabilities, but any basic users in that group would have more capabilities than the full users because the capabilities of a basic user trump group capabilities.

A full user's capabilities will depend on its assigned group; it has theoretical access to all roles and capabilities.

For more on this, see [User type](#user-type).

### Custom roles and capabilities [#custom-roles]

For tips on setting up custom roles, see [Add custom groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
