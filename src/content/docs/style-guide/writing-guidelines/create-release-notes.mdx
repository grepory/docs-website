Review the recommended [best practices for New Relic release notes](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/best-practices-for-release-notes) (Internal New Relic link). Then, to add either type of release note to the site:

1. Find the most recent release note for your agent and make a copy of it.
2. Use the established filenaming convention to name the new file.
3. Fill in the **subject**, **releaseDate**, **version**, and/or **watermark** fields.
4. Write the content for your new release note, following the established pattern.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request.

A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your pull request to get it published.
