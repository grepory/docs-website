Whether your data is in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, we apply strong encryption measures to help prevent unauthorized access, threats, or theft. This includes [FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ([FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/)).

New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services ([FedRAMP Authorized Moderate](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/new-relic?sort=productName&productNameSearch=new%20relic)) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the [confidentiality, integrity, and availability](https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/) of your data.

This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our [security documentation](/docs/security) and [Security website](https://newrelic.com/security), or contact your account representative.

## Encryption in transit [#transit-encryption]

All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. [TLS is required for all domains](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks#tls).

        Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations.

        Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2.

## Encryption at Rest

New Relic encrypts data at rest in according with the FIPS 140-2 standard. For more information, see more documentation about our [Telemetry Data Platform](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/get-started/get-know-telemetry-data-platform) and [managing data retention](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-data-retention).

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Who gets it
      </td>

      <td>
        Encryption at rest depends on your New Relic subscription, New Relic's approval, and your [account hierarchy](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts). For example, if your data is encrypted at the master account level, your sub-account data also is automatically encrypted at rest.

        Available for:

        * Government agencies
        * Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare
        * Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with [PCI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pci-compliance.asp), [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html), or [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/)

        Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative.

        Approved customers must send their data to [New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints).
