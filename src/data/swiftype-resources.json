This support is one of several advanced capabilities for Ruby web application management available now. \"Rack has given Ruby web developers a tremendous amount of freedom to innovate and experiment with new ways of building web applications,\" said Ryan Tomayko, a member of the core committer team for both Rack and Sinatra. \"Developers are increasingly turning to Rack and lightweight frameworks like Sinatra for small utility apps or for latching performance critical features onto an existing site. The ability to monitor and profile these applications using New Relic RPM fills a huge visibility gap for us.\" Written in Ruby, Sinatra is an open source web application framework and domain-specific language (DSL) that enables rapid development of Ruby web applications. Rack is modular interface for developing Ruby web applications that simplifies the interaction between HTTP requests and other web application software components by distilling APIs for these systems into a single method call. Rails Metals are minimal Rack applications that enable requests to be served more quickly. New Relic RPM is an on-demand performance management solution for web applications developed in Java, Ruby, or JRuby. RPM now provides real-time monitoring and metrics for applications running Sinatra, Rack and Rails Metals so development and deployment teams can quickly and cost-effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and tune Ruby web application performance to meet business goals. \"In the newest version of RPM’s Ruby agent we’ve added a number of significant features and support for Sinatra, Rack and Metals rank high among them,\" said Jim Gochee, New Relic’s vice-president of engineering. \"One of the great things about developing a SaaS monitoring tool and being involved with the Ruby community is witnessing the constant innovation as more and more teams deploy business-critical Ruby web applications. Sinatra and Rack are two important examples of ongoing efforts to simplify the creation of traditionally complex web applications and we look forward to working with our customers and partners as they take advantage of these projects.\" Comprehensive Web Application Management Additional features of the New Relic RPM Ruby agent 2.10 include: Enhanced Visibility into Ruby EE Garbage Collection Passenger Queue Time Capture Profiling built in to Developer Mode Enhanced JRuby Support Existing New Relic customers can download the New Relic RPM Ruby Agent 2.10 either by logging in to the RPM and selecting the upgrade option or at GitHub. To use New Relic RPM for Ruby or Java web applications for free, download RPM Lite, which includes proven application monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. It installs in two minutes and supports multiple application servers and frameworks including Rails, Sinatra, and Rack for Ruby as well as WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, JBoss, Grails, Tomcat, Glassfish, Jetty, Spring, and more for Java.

If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user. The process of enabling distributed tracing takes you through these steps: Meet the prerequisites (Infinite Tracing) Set up a trace observer Configure your agents View traces Step 1. Prerequisites Check the following sections to confirm that the distributed tracing options you want are available for your environment. Your main options are: Standard distributed tracing: Head-based sampling Infinite Tracing: Tail-based sampling Support for W3C Trace Context: Available in all Infinite Tracing agents and in standard distributed tracing agents as noted Once you find the agent version with the features you want, follow the links for help installing or updating your agent. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. C SDK Install (compile) or update to the required C SDK version. For best results, update to the latest C SDK version. Option C SDK version Standard distributed tracing 1.1.0 or higher (W3C Trace Context not available) Infinite Tracing Not available Go Install or update to the required Go agent version.

Step 4. View traces After you configure your APM agents to send data to your trace observer, you're ready to view traces. Here are two alternatives: View traces that include a specific service The Entity explorer helps you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Entity explorer in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for Infinite Tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Apps in the top menu bar. Under Favorites click Distributed tracing. In the Find traces... search, type a search clause to find the service. For example, to query service.name or trace.id: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID You can also run custom queries and create custom charts of your trace data. See Query trace data. Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.

      "info": "How to configure New Relic's Ruby agent to instrument background jobs.",
      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent) If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount: <namespace> :<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure The default <release_name> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic’s entity explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic’s entity explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL ​configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.

Support is limited to infrastructure monitoring. Integrations, such as log forwarding, may not work as expected. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 14.04.x, 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Operating systems are not supported beyond end-of-life. You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

How integrations interact with the agent is controlled by each integration's config. Understanding more about configuration can help you troubleshoot issues with your on-host integration. Overview of how configuration works New Relic's on-host integrations are external programs executed by the infrastructure agent. Each integration monitors a specific service. An integration has, at minimum, these files: An executable that exports various types of data in a JSON format expected by the agent One or more YAML-format config files (for example, the Apache integration configuration). (We recommend linting YAML config files before use to avoid formatting issues.) Note that in addition to the specific on-host integration's configuration, you can also edit the infrastructure agent's configuration. Configuration file location With standard on-host integration installations, the configuration is located in the infrastructure agent's directory. The agent determines this config location by a setting in its own configuration file. For some implementations, the integration's configuration will be located elsewhere. For example: Services running on Kubernetes: The configuration is located in the Kubernetes integration config file. Services running on Amazon ECS: The configuration is placed in the AWS console. Configuration formats On-host integrations use two configuration formats: Standard: This is the format used by most on-host integrations. This configuration uses two files: a definition file and a configuration file. For more details, see Standard configuration. Newer: Starting December 2019, infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a new format used by some integrations. This format uses a single configuration file and provides other improvements. For more details, see Newer configuration. For more help",

RPM provides Apdex metrics in application status dashboards and in detailed reports, making it easier to ensure applications are meeting end-user expectations and application performance goals. Developed by an alliance of companies concerned with helping application providers ensure end-user satisfaction, Apdex (Application Performance Index) is an open standard that defines a method for reporting, benchmarking, and tracking user satisfaction with application performance. By specifying a uniform way to measure and report user experiences, the Apdex standard helps companies assure that their applications are meeting customer needs as well as business objectives. \"We are very pleased to add New Relic RPM to the growing list of products in our certification program,\" said Peter Sevcik, Apdex Alliance executive director. \"RPM extends Apdex with capabilities that make it easier for application managers to understand when and why applications are not performing. As a member of the Apdex Alliance, New Relic shares our commitment to ensuring that enterprises can improve application and IT infrastructure performance, and better align business with IT.\" RPM is a subscription-based performance management solution that enables IT operations and developers to quickly and cost-effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and tune performance in real time. The metrics provided by RPM allow rapid discovery and analysis of performance bottlenecks and their root causes. In addition, RPM uses the Apdex performance index to continuously score applications based on the end user’s experience. With RPM’s Apdex scoring, developers and application owners can agree upon the response time goals for each application and use a simple metric to measure whether they are achieving those goals. Furthermore, with this information, managers can quickly see which applications need improvement or investment. \"The Apdex standard provides a great way to prioritize which parts of your application should be optimized first,\" said Bill Harding, founder of Bonanzle, a leading online marketplace, and New Relic customer. \"New Relic’s application performance management solution makes Apdex measurement practicable by providing a very coherent and readable graphical interface that lets you rapidly determine when a production application needs to be optimized. This way, you eliminate time spent creating subjective criteria and time spent measuring which parts of the app aren’t meeting that criteria.\" \"This standard is an important part of effective application management, and New Relic customers around the world benefit tremendously from RPM’s Apdex reporting and measurement,\" said Lew Cirne, CEO of New Relic. \"RPM provides valuable, real-time insight into application uptime, performance, and end-user response times. The certification by the Apdex Alliance provides validation that RPM offers essential capabilities for consistently improving business performance and end-user satisfaction.\" About The Apdex Alliance The Apdex Alliance is a group of companies collaborating to define and promote an application performance metric called Apdex, a numerical measure of user satisfaction with the performance of enterprise applications, and reflects the effectiveness of IT investments in contributing to business objectives. Founded in 2004 by Peter Sevcik of NetForecast, Apdex is available to any organization seeking insight into their IT investments. Visit www.Apdex.org for more information.

Attendees at RailsConf, the largest conference dedicated to Ruby on Rails, being held this week in Las Vegas, can see the new version at the New Relic booth in the exhibit hall. \"This version brings very important new capabilities for RPM,\" said Lewis Cirne, founder and CEO of New Relic. \"With this release we have enabled developers to have a closer working relationship with their peers on the management side of the business. Apdex and custom dashboards will allow developers to communicate important business metrics to the managers of their companies. We have also added a just-in-time capacity management function that allows application managers to know exactly how much capacity they are using, how much they need, and to get notified exactly when they need to deploy more. This makes cloud’s promise of dynamic capacity a reality.\" Updates to RPM include the following: Application Capacity Management Each instance of an application consumes server capacity. Many applications require multiple processes to be deployed to handle the anticipated user traffic. Whether the application is deployed in a cloud infrastructure with highly dynamic management functions or deployed in a fixed number of servers at a hosting service, more application instance processes will result in higher hosting costs. RPM now allows continuous assessment of capacity utilization and enables RPM customers to right-size each application to the needed capacity. Application management teams can react more quickly to add or reduce capacity and find the balance between cost efficiency and high performance. Apdex Support RPM continuously scores applications or individual transaction types based on the end user’s experience using the Apdex performance index. Apdex is the first user experience metric that is comparable across all transactional applications. Using the Apdex score, developers and application owners can agree upon the response time goals for each application and have a simple metric which tells them whether they are achieving those goals. Additionally, an operations manager has a single measurement to compare performance across applications. Managers can quickly see which applications need improvement or investment, namely those that have a low Apdex value but are important to the business. RPM now includes the Apdex score in the application status dashboards and in more detailed reports. More information about Apdex or the Apdex Alliance can be found at www.apdex.org. Custom Dashboard Creation Tools With its unique visibility inside the running web application, RPM can provide continuous real-time monitoring of both application performance and transaction-level business performance. RPM customers can now quickly create their own dashboards with their preferred look and feel and include technical data and/or real time business information. For example, an e-commerce site can track numbers of new customer accounts, numbers of purchase transactions, returns, and cancellations and compare today’s data with same time last week or last month. All this can be done without any special new programs or databases. With real-time monitoring, business management can react quickly to changing customer behavior.
